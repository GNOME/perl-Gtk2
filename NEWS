  [Torsten]
* Miscellaneous test updates and fixes.  [Torsten]

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.035
=================================

* Updated Glib requirement to 1.035.
* Updated ExtUtils::Depends requirement to 0.200.
* Added and updated POD in several places.  [muppet]
* Added few more straggling missing bindings.  [Torsten]
* Minor updates to example code.  [Torsten]
* As always, added more tests.  [Tortsen]

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.034
=================================

* Updated Glib requirement to 1.034.
* Updated ExtUtils::PkgConfig requirement to 1.03.
* Even yet still more tests, examples, and bugfixes.
* Improved (corrected?) handling of Gtk2::CellRenderer derivation; based on
  a more generic method for handling vfuncs as inheritable ALL_CAPS methods.
  Includes backward compatibility, plenty of documentation, and updated
  examples.  [muppet]
* Allow perl implementations of the Gtk2::CellEditable and Gtk2::TreeModel
  interfaces; two new examples included.  Huge thanks to Bjarne Steinsbo.
  [muppet]
* Per-entry callback data in SimpleMenu.  [Ross]
* Add versioning macros for Pango.  [Torsten]
* Implement startup-time version checking.  [Ross]
* Add skip_all option to Gtk2::TestHelper.  [Ross]

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.033
=================================

* Lots of new regresion tests, and exsting tests are more thorough
* apidoc POD updates.
* GdkCursor's type member now accessable.
* GdkKeys incorrect mapping fixed, unreg'd subclass warnings quelled.
* SimpleList now supports a column type markup, for pango marked-up text
* x/y event members are now available where they should be, GdkEvent doc 
  improved. corrected some invalid function -> package mappings.
* missing/TODO functions implemented in GdkDrawable
* Bug fix related to colormaps fixed in GdkGC 

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.031
=================================

* Updated Glib requirement to 1.031.
* Added binding support for objects and functions new in gtk+-2.3.x.  Not
  all tests are complete.  Updated gtk-demo and examples to use the new stuff
  if available.  This code will be protected by 2.4.0 version guards when
  gtk+-2.4.0 is finally released.  Note: The unstable-2-3-x-branch in CVS
  is now dead.  [muppet]
* New example in gtk-demo (ported from C) shows how to make hyperlinks in
  a TextView. [muppet, from gtk+]
* Converted all of the Gtk2::Gdk::Event accessors into combination accessors
  and mutators. [Ross]
* Provide a fallback implementation of Gtk2::Gdk::Event::new when linking
  against gtk+-2.0.x, so we can always create events (needed for synthesizing
  events in tests). [muppet]
* Even yet still more tests. [Torsten]
* Don't copy colors when accessing Style members; this makes it possible to
  change the colors in a style. [Torsten]
* Various little bugfixes, memory leak plugs, ornulls, doc updates, build
  enhancements, etc.

Overview of Changes from Gtk2 1.02x to 1.030
============================================

* All of the fixes on the 1.02x branch have been made here as well, including
  the 64-bit cleanliness stuff, the MessageDialog utf8 fix, and the SimpleList
  base issue that broke upgrades from really old gtk2-perl.
* Torsten has competely redone the test suite, more than doubling its size.
  Exhaustive is a good word.  Added Gtk2::TestHelper, which automates
  several tedious jobs for testing things based on Gtk2.
* Lots of general clean up.  Many small bugfixes (add ornull here, fix a broken
  call signature there, fix uninitialized variables all over the place, etc).
  Adjust ALIASed xsubs to remove invalid methods from the perl namespace.
  Never allow NULL to be passed to SvOK().
* New examples: how to use Perl threads and Gtk2 together safely; how to
  colorize rows in a SimpleList; how to add your own stock items; how to use
  inline XPM images.
* Add support for GdkRegions.  Improved support for GtkRcStyles.
* Added lots of other esoteric functions.  Our api coverage is creeping up.
* Move the implementation of the ItemFactory stuff from Perl to XS, and in
  the process fixed the bug that kept accelerators from showing up properly.
* Extended handling of GdkGeometry.  In addition to the method accessors,
  you can create the geom as a hash; the bindings will calculate the valid
  mask for you.
* Implement custom marshaller for the rows-reordered signal, making it
  usable.  (Patch from Roderich Schupp)
* Completed the implementation of SPLICE on SimpleList's TiedList class.
