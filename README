Gtk2 version 0.20
=================

Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ graphical user interface library.
This module allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a perlish and
object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory management in C,
yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.  Find out more about Gtk+
at http://www.gtk.org.

The GTK+ Reference Manual is also a handy companion when writing Gtk
programs in any language.  http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/
The perl bindings follow the C API very closely, and the C reference
documentation should be considered the canonical source.

To discuss gtk2-perl, ask questions and flame/praise the authors,
join gtk-perl-list@gnome.org at lists.gnome.org.

Also have a look at the gtk2-perl website and sourceforge project page,
http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net

FIXME we have no other documentation, but we probably need it.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


To avoid installing to a system directory, since this is a beta release,
you can change the installation prefix at Makefile.PL time with

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/other/place

This will install the module to the subdirectory lib/perl5 under the given
prefix.  If this is not already in perl's include path, you'll need to tell
perl how to get to this library directory so you can use it; there are three
ways:

  in your environment (the easiest):
    PERL5LIB=/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl:$PERL5LIB

  on the perl command line:
    perl -I /some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl yourscript

  in the code of your perl script:
    use lib '/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl';
