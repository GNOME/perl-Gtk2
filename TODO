turn examples/colorselectiontest.pl into a proper t/* test
give a better name to the entry point for gtk-demo
make gtk-demo not show the 2.2 stuff when running on 2.0
should example programs be installed?
there are plenty of unbound apis, either because of lack of interest or
	lack of need -- these should be audited.

do string columns in GtkTreeModels do automatic memory management?
if not, do we need to automate it?  are we safe with sv strings?

gdk_pixbuf_render_pixmap_and_mask_for_colormap
gdk_pixbuf_render_pixmap_and_mask
gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data <- how would we do that?

g_signal_handlers_disconnect_by_func

gtk_key_snooper_install/remove

no typemap (and therefore no bindings) for
	GdkRegion
	GdkPixbufFormat
	GdkRgbCmap
	GdkGeometry
	gunichar
	GScanner
	GtkTargetList (GtkSelection.xs)
	PangoGlyph
	PangoEngineShape
	PangoCoverage
	PangoRectangle
	PangoLayoutLine
	PangoLayoutIter

a bunch of functions are missing from GtkAccelGroup because they want 
GClosures; these would have to be mapped to CVs, of course.

GtkImage lacks support for GdkImages and GdkPixbufAnimations

many functions missing from GtkRc; no methods bound for GtkRcStyle

gdk_thread_init is supposed to be called before gtk_init.
probably should have another import option, -thread-init,
to avoid *always* enabling thread safety, since it will
be rare to have a multi-threaded perl gtk program until
perl threading is more mainstream.

need a gchar_ornull typemap

what about decorated window stuff?
